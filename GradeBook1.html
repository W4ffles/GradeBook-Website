	<br><p2 style="text-align:center;position:relative;right:10px;top:350px;">Today in Gradebookland you are able to see your grade and what you have gotten on an assignment!  You will be entering your username and password to get into your own account and see what you have done.  Lucas is an idiot and will not be reading this.  Tonight you are going to have fun looking at your grades!  Hopefully all of you are passing even though I know that that is not true.  Alright have a good day with an empty table!  Typing this is kind of fun when it happens but when it doesn't happen it doesn't but now i am just jibbering and lucas and chinmay are fight over the text-align:center shot and now he is looking at me typing this and it is kind of annoying so i am confused.</p2>
